Goal setting and habit tracking can be meticulous and mundane for some artistically driven people who want to improve themselves. Oftentimes people have difficulty setting goals and sticking to them.
To combat this problem, we created an entertaining and artistic way to guide users through a goal setting and achieving process by using a coloring book style habit tracking tree. We hope that the motivational messages, beautiful graphics, and habit counters will push users to continue striving for their goal.
